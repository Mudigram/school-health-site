## 💡 Why I Built This

During my time at university, there was no simple way to:

- Find out when doctors were available  
- Know what departments were available at the health center  
- Reach out for help in emergencies  
- Get health information without walking in physically

This project is my solution to that — a digital health center experience for students and staff.
